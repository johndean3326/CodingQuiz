# Quiz-Project

## Description

This is a Random Knowledge Quiz.

## Overview
In this project, I created a webpage that takes the user through a quiz of Eight Random knowledge questions.



unfortunately there are still some issues but honestly im mostly looking to increase my score by the two points needed to pass this challenge and i feel that i have gained a lot of functionality from its last iteration, hopefully atleast 2 points worth. Thank you for your understanding.
