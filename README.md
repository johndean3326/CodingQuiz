# Quiz-Project

## Description

This is a Random Knowledge Quiz.

## Overview
In this project, I created a webpage that takes the user through a quiz of Eight Random knowledge questions.

A timer was added to the page that would count down as the quiz was in progress. If the wrong answer was selected, the timer was reduced by 15 seconds. If the timer reached 0 before the end of the quiz, the user would be taken to the end of the quiz. The page also reacted to whether an answer was selected correctly or not. If the answer was correct, the background would change to green and, if incorrect, the page would change to red.

At the end of the quiz, the user is shown their score and is also able to enter their initials for the highscores page. 

The highscores page will show the score of each unique initial entered.
