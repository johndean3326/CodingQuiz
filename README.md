# Quiz-Project

## Description

This is a Random Knowledge Quiz.

## Overview
In this project, I created a webpage that takes the user through a quiz of Eight Random knowledge questions.



At the end of the quiz, the user is shown their score and is also able to enter their initials for the highscores page. 

The highscores page will show the score of each unique initial entered.
